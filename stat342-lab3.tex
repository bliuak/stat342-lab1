\section{Problem 1}
Let $G(t)$ be geometric Brownian motion: $G(t)=G(0)e^{\mu t + \sigma B(t)}$ where $B(t)$ 
is standard Brownian motion and $B(0)=0$. We find the value $m$ such that 
$P(G(t)< m)=0.05$. 

\proof 
We have that 
$$lnG(t)=ln(G(0))+\mu t + \sigma B(t)\sim N(ln(G(0))+\mu t, \sigma^2 t)$$
then 
$$P(G(t)< m)= 0.05$$
$$\Rightarrow P(\ln G(t) < \ln m) = \Phi(\frac{\ln m - [\ln(G(0))+\mu t]}{\sigma \sqrt{t}})$$
$$=0.05$$
$$\Rightarrow \frac{\ln m - [\ln(G(0))+\mu t]}{\sigma \sqrt{t}}=-1.645$$
$$\ln m -[\ln(G(0)) + \mu t]=-1.645\sigma \sqrt{t}$$
$$\Rightarrow \ln m = \ln(G(0))+\mu t -1.645\sigma \sqrt{t}$$
$$\Rightarrow m = G(0)e^{\mu t -1.645\sigma \sqrt{t}}$$

\section{Problem 2}
Suppose the price fluctuations of a stock are well described by absorbed Brownian motion, 
and a company is considered bankrupt if the share drops to zero. If $A(0)=5$, what 
the probability the company is bankrupt at $t=25$? 

\proof We find 
$$P(A(25)\leq 0 | A(0)=5)=1-P(A(25)>0 | A(0)=5)=1-G_t(5,0)$$
$$=1-[2\Phi(\frac{-5}{\sqrt{25}})-1]$$
$$=2\Phi(-1)$$
$$=2(0.15866)$$
$$\approx 0.3173$$
\section{Problem 3} 
In a bicycle race between two competitors, let 
$Y(t)$ denote the amount of time in seconds 
by which the racer started in the inside position 
is ahead when $100t$ percent of the race has been completed
and suppose that $\{Y(t), 0\leq t\leq 1\}$ can be effectively
modeled as a Brownian motion process with variance
parameter $\sigma^2$. 
\bi
If the inside racer is leading by 
$\sigma$ seconds at the midpoint of the 
race, what is the probability that she is the winner?
\bi
We have that $Y(0.5)=\sigma$. We find the probability that 
$$P(Y(1)>0 | Y(0.5)=\sigma)$$
We have that $Y(1)-Y(0.5)\sim N(0,\sigma^2/2)$ 
Therefore, 
$$P(Y(1)>0 | Y(0.5)=P(Y(0.5)+[Y(1)-Y(0.5)]>0))$$
$$=P(\sigma + [Y(1)-Y(0.5)] > 0)$$
$$=P(Y(1)-Y(0.5)>-\sigma)$$
standardizing $Y(1)-Y(0.5)$, we have that 
$$P(Z > -\sqrt{2})=1-\Phi(-\sqrt{2})=\Phi(\sqrt{2})$$
$$\approx 0.921$$


\bi If the inside racer wins the race by a margin of $\sigma$ 
seconds, what is the probability that she was ahead at the 
midpoint? 

\proof We note that $Y(t)=\sigma B(t)$. So we have that 
$$P(Y(0.5)>0 | Y(1)=\sigma) = P(\sigma B(0.5)> 0 | \sigma B(1)=\sigma) $$
$$=P(B(0.5)>0 | B(1)=1)$$
Since for $B(s)|B(t)$ for $0<s<t$ we have that $B(s)|B(t)=b\sim N(\frac{s}{t}b, \frac{s(t-s)}{t})$, 
then 
$$B(0.5)|B(1)=1\sim N(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{4})$$
Then 
$$P(Z>\frac{0-\frac{1}{2}}{\sqrt{\frac{1}{4}}})$$
$$=P(Z>-1)$$
$$=1-\Phi(Z\leq -1)$$
$$1-\Phi(-1)\approx 0.8413$$
