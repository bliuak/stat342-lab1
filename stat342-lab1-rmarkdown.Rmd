The simulated/emperical probability that $A$ wins the game given values of $N$ is: 


$N=20: 0.388$

$N=100: 0.113$

$N=200: 0.011$



# Question 2


The probability that $A$ wins the game given values of $N$ is approximately:

$N=20: 0.4013$

$N=100: 0.1192$

$N=200: 0.01798$ 

As N approaches infinity, it seems that the probability that $A$ wins the game approaches zero. Here's a simulation with $N=1000$

```{python}
import math
import random 

random.seed(21)

def run_simulation_question1(num_games):

    playerAwins = 0 
    playerBwins = 0 
    for i in range(num_games):
        if play_game(): 
            playerAwins += 1 
        else: 
            playerBwins += 1 

    print(f"Player A wins {playerAwins} times")
    print(f"Player B wins {playerBwins} times")

    print(f"Probability that player A wins: {playerAwins/num_games}")


def play_game(): 
    n = 1000
    i = n/2
    p = 0.49 
    while(i > 0 and i < n):
        if play_round(p): 
            i += 1 
        else: 
            i -= 1 

    return i == n # true if player A wins, false if player B wins 


def play_round(prob): # i = player 1's money, j = player 2's money

    # return true if player 1 wins, 
    # return false if player 2 wins 
    # generate a random number between 0 and 1 
    r = random.random()

    if r <= prob:
        return True
    else:
        return False
    


if __name__ == "__main__":

    run_simulation_question1(1000)

Player $A$ didn't win a single game!

# Question 3 

```{python}
import math
import random 

random.seed(21)

def run_simulation_q3(num_games, totalMoney, probWin, playAStartingAmount): 
    playerAwins = 0 
    playerBwins = 0 
    for i in range(num_games): 
        if play_game_q3(totalMoney, probWin, playAStartingAmount): 
            playerAwins += 1 
        else: 
            playerBwins += 1 

    print(f"Player A wins {playerAwins} times")
    print(f"Player B wins {playerBwins} times")
    print(f"Probability that player A wins: {playerAwins/num_games}")

def play_game_q3(totalMoney, probWin, playAStartingAmount): 
    n = totalMoney
    i = playAStartingAmount
    p = probWin 
    while(i > 0 and i < n): 
        won = play_round_q3(p)
        if won == 0: 
            i += 1 
        elif won == 1: 
            i -= 1 
        else: 
            continue 
    return i == n # if player A wins = true, if player B wins = false        
def play_round_q3(p): 

    r = random.random()
    if r <= p: 
        return 0  # Player A wins 
    elif r > p and r <= 2*p: 
        return 1  # Player B wins 
    elif r > 2*p: 
        return 2  # Tie 
      
if __name__ == "__main__":

    print(f"N = 20, P(tie) = .02, i = N/2")
    run_simulation_q3(1000, 20, .49, 10)
    print(f"N = 200, P(tie) = .02, i = N/2")
    run_simulation_q3(1000, 200, .49, 100)
    print(f"N = 20, P(tie) = .2, i = N/2")
    run_simulation_q3(1000, 20, .40, 10)
    print(f"N = 20, P(tie) = .8, i = 3N/4")
    run_simulation_q3(1000, 20, .49, 15) 
```

The code above messes around with the total money ($N$), the chance of a tie, and player $A$'s starting amount ($i$). For cases when $i = N/2$, the probability of A winning was about $.5$ (which is equal to $i/N$), regardless of the size of $N$ and the probability of a tie. When $i = 3N/4$, the probability of A winning was about $.75$, as expected.
